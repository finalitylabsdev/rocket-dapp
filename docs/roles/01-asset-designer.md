# Entropy Testnet — Asset Design Brief

> **Role:** Asset Designer (Visual / Motion / Illustration)**Scope:** Every visual asset across the Entropy platform — icons, illustrations, part artwork, box renders, animated sequences, backgrounds, brand marks, and empty‑state graphics**Your deliverables** will be placed into interfaces built by the UI/UX Interface Designer — your job is to create the *objects* that live inside those layouts

# 1. What Is This Project?

## 1.1 The Product in 60 Seconds

Entropy is a **blockchain‑based gaming platform** with four web apps:

1. **Entropy Gate** — Users lock real money (ETH) and receive a token called **φ (Entropy)** every 24 hours.
2. **Entropy Exchange** — A trading hub where users swap φ for other tokens.
3. **Star Vault & Nebula Bids** — Users buy **mystery boxes** with φ. Each box contains a random **NFT rocket part** with stats and a rarity tier. Rare parts can be **auctioned** for more φ.
4. **Celestial Assembler & Quantum Lift‑Off** — Users assemble rockets from 8 parts, launch them, get a score ("Grav Score"), and compete on a **leaderboard** for real money prizes.

**Your assets bring this universe to life.** The parts, boxes, rockets, events, and visual effects are the emotional core of the product.

## 1.2 The Universe

The Entropy universe takes place in a **stylised deep space** setting. Not hard sci‑fi realism, not cartoon. Think: **a premium mobile game's art direction meets editorial illustration** — clean, detailed enough to feel crafted, stylised enough to feel unique.

**Reference mood:**

| Avoid                              | Aim For                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Realistic NASA renders             | Stylised, slightly abstracted space — luminous, jewel‑like.        |
| Flat vector clip‑art               | Rich detail with controlled complexity.                            |
| Over‑detailed pixel art            | Clean silhouettes that read at small sizes (80px card thumbnails). |
| Generic crypto/DeFi aesthetics     | Something that looks like it belongs in a premium game world.      |
| Bright, saturated "kiddie" colours | Deep, moody palette with selective neon pops.                      |

## 1.3 Key Terms You'll See Everywhere

| Term            | What It Is                                                                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **φ (phi)**     | The Entropy token. Currency of the platform. Your main brand symbol to design.            |
| **Part**        | A rocket component. An NFT. Has a name, a section, a rarity, and 3 stats.                 |
| **Section**     | One of 8 rocket areas (engine, wings, fuel, etc.). Each section has 8 unique named parts. |
| **Rarity**      | 8 tiers from Common to Quantum. Higher = rarer, more valuable, more visually spectacular. |
| **Mystery Box** | A purchasable crate. Contains one random part. Comes in 8 tiers matching the rarities.    |
| **Grav Score**  | The score from a rocket launch. The main competitive metric.                              |
| **Star‑field**  | The animated cosmic background behind the entire platform.                                |

# 2. Brand & Style Foundation

## 2.1 Colour Palette

All your assets must harmonise with this palette. The UI designer uses these same tokens.

### Base Colours

| Name         | Hex       | Usage for Your Assets                                |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `--void`     | `#06080F` | Deep space background. Base tone for all dark areas. |
| `--void-mid` | `#0C1018` | Mid‑depth space. Card surfaces your art sits on.     |
| `--dust`     | `#1E2636` | Structural lines, subtle detail.                     |
| `--star`     | `#E8ECF4` | Highlights, bright metallic edges.                   |
| `--star-dim` | `#8A94A8` | Secondary detail, weathered metal.                   |

### App Accent Colours

Each app has a signature accent. Your assets for that app should incorporate its colour.

| App                 | Accent Hex | Colour Name   |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Entropy Gate        | `#8B5CF6`  | Deep Purple   |
| Entropy Exchange    | `#06D6A0`  | Electric Teal |
| Star Vault Boxes    | `#F6C547`  | Gold          |
| Nebula Bids         | `#A855F7`  | Violet        |
| Celestial Assembler | `#94A3B8`  | Silver        |
| Quantum Lift‑Off    | `#F97316`  | Fiery Orange  |
| Cosmic Jackpot      | `#FACC15`  | Neon Gold     |

### Rarity Colours (Critical)

Every part and every mystery box has a rarity. **The rarity colour is the single most important visual signal** in the entire product. You must design distinct visual treatments for each tier.

| Tier      | Hex       | Colour Name | Visual Intensity                                            |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Common    | `#6B7280` | Grey        | Flat, matte, no glow. Feels ordinary.                       |
| Uncommon  | `#22C55E` | Green       | Subtle sheen. Slightly elevated.                            |
| Rare      | `#3B82F6` | Blue        | Noticeable glow. Feels "good."                              |
| Epic      | `#8B5CF6` | Purple      | Prominent glow, pulsing. Feels exciting.                    |
| Legendary | `#F59E0B` | Orange      | Strong glow, shimmer effect. Feels premium.                 |
| Mythic    | `#EF4444` | Red         | Intense glow, embers/particles. Feels powerful.             |
| Celestial | `#06B6D4` | Cyan        | Ethereal glow, aurora effects. Feels otherworldly.          |
| Quantum   | Prismatic | Rainbow     | Full‑spectrum shifting. Maximum spectacle. Feels legendary. |

**The rule:** A player should be able to tell a part's rarity at a glance — even at 80px thumbnail size — purely from the visual treatment. Colour, glow, particle effects, and material finish all escalate with tier.

## 2.2 Art Style Guide

### General Style

* **Render style:** Semi‑realistic with stylised lighting. Think: Destiny 2 inventory icons, or high‑end mobile game UI art.
* **Lighting:** Dramatic, single‑source, with bloom on high‑rarity items. Light source comes from upper‑left by default.
* **Materials:** Metal, glass, energy fields, crystalline structures. All futuristic. No wood, stone, or organic textures.
* **Linework:** Clean edges. No rough/sketchy lines. High‑rarity items may have an energy aura that softens edges.
* **Detail level:** Enough to look beautiful at 400px; still readable at 80px. Silhouettes must be distinct.

### Colour Application in Art

* **Base tones:** Use the `--void` to `--dust` range for dark areas and backgrounds within the asset.
* **Metal highlights:** Use `--star` and `--star-dim` for metallic reflections.
* **Rarity integration:** The rarity colour should appear as the dominant glow, energy field, accent lighting, or material tint on the part. It should feel intrinsic to the part, not like a coloured overlay slapped on top.
* **Section identity:** Each of the 8 rocket sections should have a subtle visual language that distinguishes it (e.g., engines have exhaust nozzles, wings have aerodynamic curves, shielding has layered plates). More on this in Section 4.

# 3.1 Brand Marks & Symbols

## The φ Symbol

The φ (phi) is the most important brand mark. It represents the Entropy token and appears in the token balance HUD, transaction confirmations, price tags, buttons, and the favicon.

**Design requirements:**

* **Shape:** Based on the Greek letter φ (phi), but custom‑drawn. Not a font glyph. A geometric, slightly futuristic interpretation — the "O" can be a perfect circle or slightly squircle‑shaped, the vertical stroke is crisp and centred.
* **Style:** Clean, single‑weight stroke or filled. Should work both as an outline and filled form.
* **Sizes needed:**

| Size    | Usage                          | Format    |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | --------- |
| 16×16   | Favicon.                       | SVG + PNG |
| 20×20   | Inline body text, table cells. | SVG       |
| 24×24   | Buttons, nav bar balance.      | SVG       |
| 32×32   | Card headers, stat displays.   | SVG       |
| 48×48   | Hero sections, modal headers.  | SVG       |
| 128×128 | Marketing, splash screens.     | SVG + PNG |

* **Animated variant:** The φ has a perpetual, barely perceptible slow rotation (0.01 rpm → \~6s per full rotation, very subtle). Additionally, a "φ Pulse" animation: the symbol scales to 1.15×, emits a ring of colour that expands and fades, then settles to 1×. Duration: 600ms. This plays whenever the token balance changes. Deliver as a **Lottie file** or **CSS sprite sheet**.
* **Colour:** The φ inherits the accent colour of whatever app context it's in. Deliver in **white** (for compositing) and provide a layer/mask spec so the UI designer can apply colour dynamically.

## Entropy Wordmark

* **"ENTROPY"** in a custom‑lettered or carefully kerned display treatment.
* Works on dark backgrounds (`--void`).
* Delivered in: SVG (vector), PNG @2x (raster), light version (white on transparent), dark version (if ever needed on light backgrounds — rare).

## App Sub‑Logos

Each of the 7 app sections needs a small identifier:

| App                 | Name to Design        | Icon Concept                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Entropy Gate        | "ENTROPY GATE"        | Portal / gateway / doorway shape.      |
| Entropy Exchange    | "ENTROPY EXCHANGE"    | Arrows / swap / flow shape.            |
| Star Vault Boxes    | "STAR VAULT"          | Chest / vault / crystalline box.       |
| Nebula Bids         | "NEBULA BIDS"         | Gavel / bid paddle / ascending arrow.  |
| Celestial Assembler | "CELESTIAL ASSEMBLER" | Wrench / puzzle piece / modular shape. |
| Quantum Lift‑Off    | "QUANTUM LIFT‑OFF"    | Rocket / flame / upward arrow.         |
| Cosmic Jackpot      | "COSMIC JACKPOT"      | Trophy / crown / starburst.            |

Each sub‑logo: icon (24×24 SVG) + text lockup (SVG). Icon should work standalone in the tab bar.

# 3.2 Background & Atmosphere

## Animated Star‑Field

The entire platform has a dark cosmic background that subtly moves.

**Specification:**

| Property           | Spec                                                                              |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stars**          | 200–400 small white dots (1–2px diameter), randomised opacity (0.3–1.0).          |
| **Parallax**       | Stars shift ±10px on mouse move (desktop) or gyroscope (mobile).                  |
| **Nebula patches** | 3–5 large soft radial gradients in muted colours, slowly drifting (0.5px/second). |
| **Framerate**      | 30fps canvas animation.                                                           |
| **Fallback**       | Static high‑res image (3840×2160) for low‑power devices.                          |

**Delivery:** As a self‑contained `<canvas>` component (JavaScript) OR as a Lottie/video loop (30s, seamless). Also deliver the static fallback as PNG @2x.

## Nebula Haze Overlays

When the user navigates to a different app, a soft colour haze fades in over the star‑field.

**Delivery:** 7 radial gradient textures (one per app accent colour), PNG with transparency, 1920×1080 @2x. The UI designer will composite these with CSS blend modes.

| App                 | Haze Colour |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| Entropy Gate        | Purple haze |
| Entropy Exchange    | Teal haze   |

A scene illustration for the Quantum Lift‑Off pre‑launch screen.

* Shows a futuristic launch platform floating in space.
* No rocket (the assembled rocket will be composited on top).
* Atmospheric lighting, dramatic perspective.
* **Delivery:** PNG @2x, 1200×800, transparent background so it layers over the star‑field.

# 3.3 Mystery Box Renders

You need to design **8 distinct box appearances**, one per rarity tier. These boxes are the first thing a player interacts with in Star Vault — they must be exciting, collectible‑feeling objects.

## Box Design per Tier

| Tier          | Visual Direction                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Common**    | Simple grey cube. Matte metallic finish. No glow, no ornamentation. Feels utilitarian.                                                                              |
| **Uncommon**  | Grey‑green cube. Subtle inner light (green). Faint panel lines. Slightly elevated from Common.                                                                      |
| **Rare**      | Blue metallic cube. Visible energy seams. Soft blue outer glow. Engraved geometric patterns.                                                                        |
| **Epic**      | Purple crystalline box. Faceted edges like a gemstone. Visible internal energy. Pulsing purple glow.                                                                |
| **Legendary** | Gold ornate box. Engraved filigree lines that glow. Warm amber light from within. Diagonal shimmer sweep.                                                           |
| **Mythic**    | Red molten box. Surface appears to crack and glow with internal fire. Ember particles float up from corners.                                                        |
| **Celestial** | Cyan translucent box. Ethereal, almost glass‑like. Aurora wave flowing across its surface. Icy glow.                                                                |
| **Quantum**   | Prismatic shifting box. Impossible‑looking. Surface cycles through the full spectrum. Edges seem to glitch or phase. Animated rainbow border. The "holy grail" box. |

### Deliverables per Tier

| Asset                           | Spec                                                                                                 | Format                 |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Box Closed (static)**         | 400×400, centred, transparent background.                                                            | PNG @2x + SVG          |
| **Box Closed (idle animation)** | For Epic+ tiers only: subtle loop (glow pulse, shimmer, embers, aurora, prismatic shift). 2–4s loop. | Lottie or APNG         |
| **Box Crack sequence**          | The full "opening" animation. See spec below.                                                        | Lottie or sprite sheet |
| **Box Halves (post‑open)**      | The two split halves, separated, resting. Used as background behind the revealed part.               | PNG @2x                |

### Box Crack Animation Spec

This is the **most important animation in the entire product** — the moment a player discovers their part.

| Phase      | Duration | What Happens                                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rumble** | 300ms    | Box shakes subtly (±2px random offset).                                                                                         |
| **Seam**   | 400ms    | A bright line of the rarity colour appears vertically down the centre of the box.                                               |
| **Crack**  | 600ms    | Line widens. The two halves begin to separate horizontally. Light pours out.                                                    |
| **Split**  | 500ms    | Halves fly apart (±80px). A burst of particles in the rarity colour erupts from the centre.                                     |
| **Settle** | 700ms    | Halves slow to rest at ±120px offset. Particles fade. The space between is clear for the part card (composited by UI designer). |

**Total:** \~2500ms.

**Per‑tier variation:** The particle burst should match the tier's visual treatment:

* Common–Rare: Simple dot particles.
* Epic–Legendary: Larger, slower particles with glow trails.
* Mythic: Ember/fire particles.
* Celestial: Ice crystal / aurora ribbon particles.
* Quantum: Prismatic glitching / holographic shards.

# 4. Rocket Part Illustrations

This is the **largest single deliverable**: **64 unique part illustrations** (8 sections × 8 named parts per section). Additionally, each part can exist at any of the 8 rarity tiers, so you'll need a system for applying rarity visual treatments.

## 4.1 The 8 Sections — Visual Language

Each section should have a **recognisable silhouette family** so players can identify the section at a glance, even at thumbnail size.

### Section 1 — Core Engine

## 4.2 Rarity Visual Treatment System

Rather than drawing 64 × 8 = 512 separate images, design a **layered rarity treatment** that can be composited over any base part illustration.

| Rarity    | Treatment Applied to Base Art                                                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Common    | As‑is. Base colours from the `--dust` / `--star-dim` range. Matte finish. No glow.              |
| Uncommon  | Slightly brighter base tones. Faint green accent lighting on edges.                             |
| Rare      | Blue accent lighting. Soft outer glow layer. Metallic sheen on surfaces.                        |
| Epic      | Purple accent lighting. Pulsing glow layer (for animated contexts). Energy veins on surface.    |
| Legendary | Gold accent lighting. Strong glow. Shimmer sweep layer (diagonal light pass, 4s loop).          |
| Mythic    | Red accent lighting. Intense glow. Ember particle overlay drifting upward.                      |
| Celestial | Cyan accent lighting. Ethereal glow. Aurora wave overlay flowing across surface.                |
| Quantum   | Full prismatic shifting. All accent colours cycle. Edge glitch/phase effect. Maximum spectacle. |

**Delivery approach:**

1. **Base illustrations (64):** Delivered in a neutral tone (no rarity treatment). PNG @2x, 400×400, transparent background.
2. **Rarity overlay layers (8):** Separate PNG layers or Lottie overlays that the UI developer composites on top. Alternatively, provide a **style guide sheet** showing exactly how to apply each tier's treatment (lighting angles, glow radius, particle specs).
3. **Pre‑rendered hero versions:** For marketing and featured displays, pre‑render a few key parts at high rarity (e.g., Hyper‑Drive at Quantum, Event‑Horizon Shield at Celestial). 6–8 hero renders at 800×800.

## 4.3 Part Illustration Delivery Specs

| Property           | Spec                                                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dimensions**     | 400×400 (display at 200×200 on retina).                           |
| **Background**     | Transparent.                                                      |
| **Orientation**    | Centred, max \~80% of canvas used. Consistent padding.            |
| **Format**         | PNG @2x. Also deliver SVG if vector‑based.                        |
| **Naming**         | `section-name_part-name.png` e.g., `core-engine_pulse-engine.png` |
| **Thumbnail test** | Must be identifiable at 80×80.                                    |

# 7. Priority Order

If you need to phase the work, here's the recommended order from highest to lowest impact:

| Priority | Assets                                            | Why                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **P0**   | φ symbol, Entropy wordmark, star‑field background | Needed before any screen can be assembled.            |
| **P1**   | Mystery box renders (8 tiers) + crack animations  | The core "wow" moment of the product.                 |
| **P1**   | Section icons (8) + rarity badge icons (8)        | Used everywhere — inventory, cards, builder, auction. |
| **P2**   | Part illustrations (64) + rarity overlay system   | The product's main collectible content.               |
| **P2**   | UI icon set (\~30)                                | Functional requirement for all screens.               |
| **P3**   | Event icons + card illustrations (6 events)       | Needed for launch experience.                         |
| **P3**   | Launch VFX (flame, streaks, exhaust)              | Needed for launch experience.                         |
| **P3**   | Rocket blueprint schematic                        | Needed for builder screen.                            |
| **P4**   | Celebration assets (confetti, trophy, medals)     | Leaderboard and prize claim polish.                   |
| **P4**   | Empty state illustrations (4)                     | UX polish.                                            |
| **P4**   | App sub‑logos (7) + nebula overlays + launch pad  | Brand polish and atmosphere.                          |
